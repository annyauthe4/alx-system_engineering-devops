# POSTMORTEM:  WEBSTACK DEBUGGING INCIDENT
```````````````````````````````````````````

ISSUE SUMMARY
`````````````
At 10:13 AM UTC on March 2, 2025, our monitoring system alerted us that the website was down. Users attempting to access the site experienced prolonged loading times, timeouts, or received "502 Bad Gateway" errors. We quickly identified that the database was unresponsive, further contributing to the outage. Initial troubleshooting efforts, including restarting Nginx at 10:20 AM, did not resolve the issue. Upon further investigation at 10:50 AM, we discovered that a rogue process had consumed all available memory, severely impacting system performance. After terminating the process, the site became accessible again at 11:05 AM, though performance remained suboptimal. A subsequent review of the Nginx configuration at 11:20 AM revealed that it was incorrectly pointing to a non-existent upstream, further exacerbating the issue. By 11:45 AM, we corrected the configuration and restarted Nginx, restoring normal functionality. Additional optimizations were applied over the next hour to address lingering memory issues, and by 12:50 PM, the incident was fully resolved.

## Timeline
10:13 AM – Our monitoring system alerted us that the website was down.
10:15 AM – An engineer verified the issue and confirmed that the site was completely inaccessible.
10:20 AM – We restarted Nginx, expecting a quick resolution, but the issue persisted.
10:35 AM – We suspected a database failure and checked MySQL logs, but no immediate anomalies were found.
10:50 AM – Upon running htop, we identified a process consuming excessive memory, causing system-wide slowdowns. We terminated the process.
11:05 AM – The website became accessible but remained significantly slow.
11:20 AM – Further investigation revealed that Nginx was misconfigured, pointing to a non-existent upstream.
11:45 AM – We corrected the Nginx configuration and restarted the service.
12:10 PM – Additional optimizations were applied to address lingering memory issues.
12:50 PM – The incident was fully resolved, and normal operations were restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution

## Root Cause:
The Nginx configuration file contained an incorrect upstream reference, preventing proper request routing.
A background process (likely a misconfigured script) consumed all available memory, leading to resource exhaustion and database unresponsiveness.
Resolution:
We updated the Nginx configuration to point to the correct upstream server.
The rogue process was identified and terminated, and resource limits were enforced to prevent similar issues in the future.
We cleared caches, restarted affected services, and verified system stability before concluding the resolution.
Corrective and Preventative Measures

## Key Takeaways
Proactive monitoring of memory usage is critical to preventing unexpected outages.
Configuration validation should be implemented before deployment to prevent misconfigurations.
A structured debugging approach minimizes downtime and accelerates resolution.

## Action Items
✅ Implement automated Nginx configuration validation in the deployment pipeline.
✅ Enforce memory usage limits to prevent processes from consuming excessive resources.
✅ Enhance monitoring alerts to detect high memory utilization before it impacts service availability.
✅ Document the debugging process and resolution steps for future reference.

The incident reinforced the importance of rigorous configuration management and proactive system monitoring. We will incorporate these improvements to enhance our system’s resilience moving forward.
