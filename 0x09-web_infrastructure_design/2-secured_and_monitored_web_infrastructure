Components and Roles
1. Additional Elements
Firewalls (3 Total):

	Why Added: Firewalls control and restrict access to each part of the infrastructure, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and attacks.
	Placement:
	Firewall 1: Between the internet and the load balancer to block malicious requests.
	Firewall 2: Between the load balancer and the web/application servers to allow only traffic from trusted sources.
	Firewall 3: Between the application servers and the database to ensure only application servers can query the database.
	SSL Certificate:

	Why Added: To serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS, encrypting all data exchanged between users and the server.
	Role:
	Prevents data interception and ensures privacy.
	Increases user trust by showing a secure connection.
	Monitoring Clients (3 Total):

		Why Added: To track server performance, uptime, and error rates, providing insights for proactive maintenance.
		Placement:
		Installed on the load balancer, web/application servers, and database.
		Security Enhancements
		Firewalls
		Role: Act as gatekeepers to the network, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on defined security rules.
		Benefits:
		Block unauthorized traffic.
		Protect against DDoS attacks and brute force attempts.
		HTTPS
		Role: Encrypts data exchanged between users and the website.
		Benefits:
		Prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
		Ensures user credentials, payment details, and sensitive data remain confidential.
		Monitoring
		Purpose
		Detect server failures, performance bottlenecks, and security breaches.
		Provide metrics such as request-per-second (QPS), CPU usage, memory usage, and database query times.
		How Monitoring Tools Collect Data
		Monitoring Clients:
		Installed on each component (e.g., load balancer, application servers, database).
		Send metrics (logs, errors, and performance data) to a centralized service like Sumo Logic, Datadog, or Prometheus.
		Monitoring Web Server QPS
		Steps:
		Install a monitoring agent on the web server.
		Configure the agent to track incoming HTTP requests using Nginx logs.
		Send the data to the centralized monitoring tool.
		Use dashboards or alerts to visualize QPS and set thresholds for alerts.
		Issues with This Infrastructure
		Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:

		Explanation: SSL termination decrypts traffic at the load balancer, forwarding unencrypted data to web/application servers.
		Problem: Data remains vulnerable during transmission between the load balancer and servers.
		Solution: Use end-to-end encryption by re-encrypting traffic between the load balancer and servers.
		One MySQL Server for Writes:

		Explanation: All write operations rely on the Primary database.
		Problem: A failure of the Primary leads to write unavailability.
		Solution: Implement automatic failover or multi-primary setups to ensure continuous write availability.
		All Servers Having the Same Components:

		Explanation: Combining database, application server, and web server on the same machine creates resource contention.
		Problem: A high database load can slow down the web server, causing cascading failures.
		Solution: Use dedicated servers for each role (web, application, and database) for better resource isolation.
