**Project Overview**
This repository contains the design and documentation for the web infrastructure of an AirBnB Clone project. The architecture illustrates how the various components of the system interact to provide a robust, scalable, and secure platform for users to browse listings, book accommodations, and manage their accounts.

The goal of this design is to create a high-performing system capable of handling user traffic efficiently, ensuring high availability, and maintaining data security.

**1. Introduction**
The AirBnB Clone web infrastructure design focuses on a three-tier architecture:

Frontend Layer: Manages user interactions and interfaces.
Application Layer: Handles business logic and API requests.
Database Layer: Stores and retrieves user and listing data.
This design ensures:

Scalability to handle growing user demand.
Fault Tolerance to minimize downtime.
Security to protect user data and system integrity.


**2. System Diagrams**
Included Diagrams:
Basic Infrastructure: Single server setup for initial development.
Scalable Architecture: Multi-tier architecture with load balancing and database replication.
Advanced Distributed System: Globally distributed system for high availability.
All diagrams are located in the video with URL link.


**3. Infrastructure Components**
**Frontend**
Load Balancer: Distributes user traffic to multiple servers for better performance.
Web Servers: Serves the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.

**Application**
API Servers: Processes user requests and serves responses.
Task Queue: Manages background tasks like sending emails or generating reports.


**Database**
Primary Database: Stores listings, user data, and booking details.
Replica Databases: Provides redundancy and improves read performance.


**Networking and Security**
Content Delivery Network (CDN): Caches and serves static assets globally.
Firewalls: Protect servers from unauthorized access.
HTTPS: Secures all user communication with SSL/TLS.


**4. Key Features**
Redundancy: Eliminates single points of failure with replicated servers and databases.
Scalability: Supports horizontal scaling to handle high traffic.
Data Integrity: Regular database backups and recovery plans.
Monitoring: Tools like Prometheus or New Relic are integrated for real-time system health checks.
