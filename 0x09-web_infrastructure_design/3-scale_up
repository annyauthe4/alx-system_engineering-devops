1. Load Balancer Cluster
Configuration: Active-Passive setup ensures no SPOF at the load balancing layer.
SSL Termination: Encrypted traffic terminates at the load balancer but is re-encrypted for end-to-end security.
Algorithm: Round Robin distributes traffic evenly across servers.

2. Firewalls
Firewall 1: Filters incoming traffic to the load balancer from the internet.
Firewall 2: Restricts communication between the load balancer and the web server.
Firewall 3: Protects the application server by allowing only traffic from the web server.
Firewall 4: Secures the database by permitting access only from the application server.

3. Web Server (Nginx with SSL)
	Role: Handles static content and passes dynamic requests to the application server.
	SSL: Ensures HTTPS for encrypted communication between users and the web server.

4. Application Server
Role: Processes dynamic requests and interacts with the database to fetch or store data.

5. Database Cluster
Primary Node: Handles write operations and syncs data to the Replica.
Replica Node: Processes read-only queries, reducing load on the Primary.


6. Monitoring Clients
Tools: Sumo Logic, Datadog, or Prometheus collect performance metrics and logs.
Coverage: Installed on every server and the load balancer.
Tracked Metrics:
HTTP requests per second (QPS).
Server uptime and response times.
Database query latency and replication status.
