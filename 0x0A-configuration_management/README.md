# Configuration Management Basics

## Overview
Configuration management is a critical aspect of IT operations, enabling the automation of managing, monitoring, and maintaining computer systems, software, and networks. It ensures consistency, reliability, and efficiency across environments by defining configurations as code.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.
   - Tools: Puppet, Ansible, Chef, Terraform.

### 2. **Version Control**
   - Tracking and managing changes to configuration files and scripts.
   - Tools: Git, Subversion (SVN).

### 3. **Automation**
   - Reducing manual intervention by automating repetitive tasks.
   - Benefits: Saves time, reduces human errors, ensures consistency.

### 4. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - Automated testing, integration, and deployment of changes to configurations and applications.
   - Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI, Travis CI.

### 5. **Orchestration**
   - Managing and coordinating automated tasks across complex environments.
   - Tools: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm.

## Popular Configuration Management Tools

### 1. **Puppet**
   - Declarative language to define system configurations.
   - Ideal for managing large-scale infrastructures.

### 2. **Ansible**
   - Agentless tool using SSH for automation.
   - Simple syntax (YAML) for playbooks.

### 3. **Chef**
   - Uses Ruby-based DSL for configurations.
   - Focuses on flexibility and scalability.

### 4. **Terraform**
   - IaC tool for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
   - Uses declarative configuration files.

NOTE: For this project, puppet is preferred

## Benefits of Configuration Management
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform configurations across multiple environments.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates scaling infrastructure without manual intervention.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Simplifies recovery by maintaining configuration backups.
- **Auditability**: Provides clear records of changes for compliance and auditing.

## Getting Started with Puppet
1. **Install Puppet**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install puppet
